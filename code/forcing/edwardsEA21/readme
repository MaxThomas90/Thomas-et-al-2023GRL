edwards_ssps.py produces timeseries of Antarctic contribution to sea level rise
as projected by Edwards et al. (2021)
and saves the results as figures
All data were retrieved from https://github.com/tamsinedwards/emulandice on 6th August 2021 at 09:26 NZ local time
/main contains the main projection from Edwards et al.
	these were copied from emulandice-master/results/proj_MAIN_TIMESERIES/ 
/risk_averse contains the risk averse (pessemistic) projections
        these were copied from emulandice-master/results/proj_S11_TIMESERIES/
the projections from individual ssps in /main and /risk_averse retain their original filenames
to run script: 
    source activate analysis
